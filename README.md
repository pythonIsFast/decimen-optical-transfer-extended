# Decimen Optical Transfer: fountain-coded QR file transfer

Send a file between two devices using nothing but a **screen and a camera**.
One page displays the file as an endless stream of animated QR codes; another
device points its camera at it and reconstructs the file. **No network path
between the devices, no app, no pairing, no permissions beyond the camera.**
The payload travels as light.

## Try it

### **→ [decimen.app](https://decimen.app/)**

Open it on both devices and go — nothing to install. Works offline after the
first visit, and installs as an app on both iOS and Android if you want it on
a home screen.

Files up to 64 MB in a single stream — larger ones split into segments and
reassembled on arrival — or a pasted text snippet. Filename and media type
preserved, gzip only when it helps, SHA-256 verified before anything is
offered — and received video plays right in the page. Expect hundreds of KB/s
screen to camera, depending on the two devices and the light.

Neither mode is encrypted: whatever is on the sending screen is readable by
any camera pointed at it. The property this gives you is no network, not
confidentiality — see [privacy](docs/user/privacy.md).

The short version of the protocol: a screen-to-camera link has no
back-channel, so the sender streams fountain-coded frames ([Luby
transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luby_transform_code)) — the receiver
collects *any* ~K·1.15 distinct frames in any order and peels the file out.
Dropped frames cost time, never correctness.

## Run it yourself

```bash
npm install
npm run dev               # https dev server with HMR
npm run serve             # build, then serve the production bundle
npm run diagnostics       # dev server + per-transfer run reports in the terminal
npm test                  # golden wire-format vectors and unit tests
npm run build             # the hosted site → dist/
npm run build:standalone  # both self-contained pages → dist-standalone/
npm run build:all         # everything
```

Open `https://localhost:5173/send/` on the sending device and the printed
`Network` URL on the receiving phone (accept the self-signed certificate
once). Walkthrough: [quick start](docs/user/quick-start.md).

The concept here was arrived at independently. It turns out several people
have had similar ideas, and their takes are all worth a look:

- [mohankumarelec/airgapped-qr-code-transfer](https://github.com/mohankumarelec/airgapped-qr-code-transfer):
  browser-based QR file transfer with compression and sequential chunking.
  Discovered after publicly demoing this project; convergent evolution in
  action.
- [divan/txqr](https://github.com/divan/txqr) (2018): animated QR plus
  fountain codes in Go, with two excellent write-ups on why fountain coding
  beats sequential looping.
- [sz3/libcimbar](https://github.com/sz3/libcimbar): goes past QR entirely
  with a custom high-density color code purpose-built for this channel.
